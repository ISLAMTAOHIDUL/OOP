1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes a program around objects and classes, allowing real-world modeling and modular design.

🔹 2. Class

A class is a user-defined blueprint that contains data members and member functions used to create objects.

🔹 3. Object

An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity and occupies memory.

🔹 4. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of hiding data members by declaring them private and providing controlled access through public member functions.

🔹 5. Data Hiding

Data hiding restricts direct access to sensitive data to protect it from misuse.

🔹 6. Setter Method

A setter is a public member function used to modify private data members safely, often with validation.

🔹 7. Getter Method

A getter is a public member function used to retrieve private data members without allowing direct modification.

🔹 8. Constructor

A constructor is a special member function that is automatically invoked when an object is created to initialize data members.

🔹 9. Default Constructor

A default constructor is a constructor that takes no parameters.

🔹 10. Parameterized Constructor

A parameterized constructor initializes an object using arguments passed at creation time.

🔹 11. Static Data Member

A static data member is shared among all objects of a class and exists only once in memory.

🔹 12. Static Member Function

A static member function can access only static data members and does not require an object.

🔹 13. File Handling (File I/O)

File handling allows programs to store and retrieve data permanently using files.

🔹 14. ofstream

ofstream is an output file stream used to write data to a file.

🔹 15. ifstream

ifstream is an input file stream used to read data from a file.

🔹 16. Exception Handling

Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, catch, and throw.

🔹 17. Custom Exception

A custom exception is a user-defined class used to handle specific errors.

🔹 18. Template

A template allows writing generic code that works for multiple data types.

🔹 19. Function Template

A function template defines a function that can operate with different data types.

🔹 20. Class Template

A class template defines a generic class that works with multiple data types.

🔹 21. STL (Standard Template Library)

The STL is a collection of ready-made containers, algorithms, and iterators in C++.

🔹 22. STL Vector

A vector is a dynamic array that automatically resizes and stores elements contiguously.

🔹 23. Vector of Objects

A vector of objects stores multiple user-defined class objects dynamically.

🔹 24. Iterator

An iterator is an object used to traverse elements in STL containers.

🔹 25. Algorithm (STL)

STL algorithms perform operations like searching and sorting on containers.

🔹 26. Menu-Driven Program

A menu-driven program allows users to choose operations repeatedly using options.

🔹 27. Data Persistence

Data persistence ensures data remains available even after the program terminates.

🔹 28. Auto-Increment ID

An auto-increment ID is generated automatically using a static variable to ensure uniqueness.

🔹 29. Const Member Function

A const member function guarantees that the object’s data will not be modified.

🔹 30. Scope Resolution Operator (::)

The scope resolution operator is used to define static members outside the class.

🔹 31. Exception Safety

Exception safety ensures the program remains stable even if errors occur.

🔹 32. Object Persistence

Object persistence means storing object data in files so it can be restored later.
